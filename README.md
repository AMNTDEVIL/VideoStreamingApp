This is an ongoing project to build a backend service for a video streaming application using Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Backblaze B2 cloud storage. The goal is to handle video upload, processing (compression, segmentation), storage, and downloading with smooth streaming support.

In addition, the project includes development of a mobile Android app using Flutter & Dart to provide a seamless frontend experience.

Key features under development:

* Video upload and storage

* Video compression into multiple resolutions (360p, 480p, 720p) using FFmpeg

* Video segmentation into small chunks for adaptive streaming

* Video metadata management with JSON maps

* Messaging with RabbitMQ for asynchronous task handling

* Integration with Backblaze B2 for scalable cloud storage

* Android app development using Flutter & Dart for frontend
